- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ShilpaNidoniGit
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in exploring Java
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working as Java programmer
- ðŸ“« I also have versatile experience as full stack developer using javascript, jQuery, Angular, java, oracle, postgres & docker
     I would like to create more GitHub projects to demonstrate real time examples to help the java lerners & developers.
